1. Read the whole track form .trk file(original space not voxel cordinate)
2. Calculating the length of all streamline (according the dipy function)
3.  Filter the streamline(with the length less than 10)
4.  then we have a modified tracktography with ~200k streamlines
5. Now for the check of crossing
     
    Next step: (checking the crossing)
1. take an empty dictionary
2. take one streamline form 200k streamlines
3. Find the list of voxel, it goes through
             check if the voxel of that streamline is already in the dictionary then 
                   break (not take that) 
             otherwise
                    add  those voxel in a dictinary
                    add the id of the streamline

   
     Form the whole procedure , ~1500 streamline found And then  use the FFT
